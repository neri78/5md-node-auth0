# 5md-node-auth0

This project is intended to showcase authentication feature from Auth0.  
The goals are:

- The whole demo can be completed within 5 minutes.
- The demo should include Live Coding, ideally from scratch or starting from the minimal codebase - the demo should include UI. 
- The sample should create the impression of easiness -  _“Hey, I can try this now/later.”_
- Storytelling - __“Yes, I need to use THIS.”__ 
- Provide the next step for CTA.

The demo is also based on the following resources:

- [GitHub - auth0-samples/auth0-express-webapp-sample](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-express-webapp-sample)
- [YouTube - Add Node.js User Authentication in 10 Minutes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQwo4E_B0y8)
